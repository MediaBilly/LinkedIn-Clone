# Linkedin-Clone
An assignment for the Web Application Technologies course where we were asked to implement a web app like LinkedIn.

The app was developed using [Angular](https://angular.io/) for the Front-End, [NestJs](https://nestjs.com/) for the BackEnd and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for the database.
